# React Router Tutorial README

This README file provides an overview of the React Router tutorial that I found at [React Router Official Website](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial#jsx-routes). The tutorial demonstrates how to set up and use React Router in a React application. While the tutorial is very comprehensive, you will find my code to functioning, but not complete. I've purposely not completed the entire tutorial as I went as far as I needed to go to understand the system.

This is a contacts application that uses the browser's local storage to save a list of contacts. It contains a few routes such as "edit" and "delete" and some lesser, but just as important routes such as the homepage or when no contact is selected.
